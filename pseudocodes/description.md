With these modifications, the `DockingCircuit` class should be optimized to use the Kimchi proof system in MINA protocol. Note that this is just a basic example, and there may be additional optimizations or modifications that can be made depending on the specific requirements of your application.

Specific optimization that might be needed:

1. Batch proving: If multiple protein docking experiments need to be verified, it may be more efficient to batch the proving process to verify multiple solutions at once. This can be done by combining the witnesses and public inputs for multiple experiments into a single circuit instance, and then calling the `generateProof()` method once with all of the combined inputs. This can significantly reduce the overhead of generating proofs for each individual experiment.
2. Precomputation: If certain calculations or operations are expensive and are performed repeatedly, it may be possible to precompute some of the values to improve performance. For example, if there are specific values or functions that are used frequently, these can be precomputed and stored in memory to avoid redundant calculations. This can be especially useful for complex circuits with large or frequently used intermediate values.
3. Circuit optimization: Depending on the specific requirements of the circuit, there may be opportunities to optimize the structure or operations used in the circuit to reduce the number of constraints or the size of the proving key. For example, if certain intermediate values are used frequently, it may be possible to reduce the number of constraints by introducing new variables or simplifying the circuit structure. Similarly, certain operations may be expensive in terms of circuit constraints or proving time, so it may be beneficial to optimize or simplify these operations if possible.
4. Proof verification optimization: Once the proof has been generated, the verifier can optimize the proof verification process to reduce the time and resources required to verify the proof. This can be done by using more efficient algorithms or data structures to verify the proof, or by using specialized hardware or software to accelerate the verification process.
