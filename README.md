### **Intro**

Drug and biotech development is an expensive and slow process. A single therapy might take up to 10 years to develop and anywhere between $300M-2.2B. 

The culprit is poor reproducibility in basic research and siloing of data and results. As decentralized science is  already taking off, a solution would be essen
tial for effective co-development. 

**BioSNARKS open up new possibilities for accelerated and more democratized drug and biotech development, by allowing participants to share or trade validated data, IP, protocols, targets without revealing sensitive information.**

### **Problem statement**

According to industry group PhRMA, it takes 10-15 years on average to develop one new medicine from initial discovery through regulatory approval. The average cost of creating a new drug range as high as $2.6 billion USD. According to the BIO report, the average likelihood of approval for all drugs in Phase I development is only 7.9%. That means that more than 9 out of every 10 drugs in Phase I research are not approved. This is extremely worrying and inefficient.

**Culprit 1: Data Silos**

Siloing of data, which include burying of data viewed as neutral or negative for an academic or pharma entity (otherwise executed with proper protocols) slows down science. Particularly, this is a huge problem for rare disease research.

The advances in genetics and immunology have led to increased research and development activities for previously unknown disorders. However, the creation of proprietary data silos by various stakeholders has fragmented the expanding knowledge base and slowed the development of much-needed treatments. The lack of meaningful outcome measures and good natural history data further hinders progress in benefiting underserved patient populations. This system promotes redundant data collection, delaying potential treatments for tractable diseases and wasting precious resources. The National Institutes of Health and Food and Drug Administration have started programs to address these issues, but more discussion is needed to coordinate and scale registry efforts. Such discourse aims to reduce complexity and duplication of efforts, promote a pre-competitive knowledge ecosystem for rare disease drug development, and accelerate innovation. The current research and development landscape often sets projects up for unnecessary failure, particularly in the rare disease sphere, and does a disservice to vulnerable patients.

**Culprit 2: Eroom's law**

Eroom's law is the observation that drug discovery is becoming slower and more expensive over time, despite improvements in technology (such as high-throughput screening, biotechnology, combinatorial chemistry, and computational drug design). The term was coined by Dr Jack Scannell and colleagues in 2012 in Nature Reviews Drug Discovery.

There are four main problems identified in Eroom's law. We focus on the 4th, as it has direct relevance to applications where ZK enabled technologies could accelerate collaboration and data exchange. This problem is known as the "basic research-brute force" bias, where the ability of advances in basic research and screening methods to show a molecule as safe and effective in clinical trials is overestimated. Drug discovery techniques have shifted from whole-animal testing to target-based approaches, resulting in the discovery of drugs that may tightly bind to target proteins but still fail in clinical trials due to under-appreciation of the whole organism's complexity. High-throughput screening approaches may also be less productive despite being faster and cheaper.

### **Solution**

Currently there is a huge demand to accelerate bioscience discovery by resource pooling of e.g. wet and dry lab biology experiments. From drug discovery to biomanufacturing, reproducibility is crucial. Moreover, bioscience experiments can scale highly if they can serve multiple participants and after execution, results or data can be exchanged.

As of 2018, academic spinouts and small biotech startups have surpassed Big Pharma with respect to the number of best-selling drugs approved, with 24/30 (80%) originating outside of Big Pharma. This signals an extensive need to interact between industry and other players, including decentralized, with tools that can lead to improvement.

**We propose BioSNARKS, a zk- that could be implemented to biological and biochemical pipeline processes to prove work, optimization, state, prediction, protocol or knowledge, without revealing processes or IP sensitive information.**

Detailed example of use cases:

1. An expensive and risky experiment (such as a biology experiment launched to space, or a computational and material demanding binding study) is funded by multiple participants. For example, A (academia) and B1 (biopharma company) and B2 (tech company ). All entities need validation that the experiment was executed according to defined protocol and data was gathered according to protocol - even at hardware level. However, the entities might not necessary have to know about which part of the experiment they are focusing on, and a third party "oracle", not revealing this content fractionalize data or results to the entities
2. Similarly, negative or neutral data from academia or biopharma can be absolutely insightful for different entities. This part of data could be traded or transferred, with proof that it was done according to a validated protocol, or part of a pipeline, without revealing the full scope of the original experimental scope, in case it is IP sensitive. Moreover, as DAOs are getting attractive innovation platforms for biopharma (examples: VitaDAO, GenomicDAO), ZK-proof of asset effectiveness, preliminary or preclinical results and exchanging this between DAO and industry, stakeholders is an attractive opportunity for safe co-development. This proposal would prioritize to pilot a possible DAO-biohparma-stakeholder ZK-proof study.
3. Use cases as of 1-2, with fractionalization of need and generation of validated "ZK-NFTs" or "ZK-IP-NFT"s. This is also in line with use case 2, especially for DAO space.
4. Use cases as of 1-2, where in addition of proof of protocol, or work or optimization, a proof of solution is presented (energy minimaziation, docking, folding, prediction, etc.)
5. Use of biobank data (inspiration literature e.g.: Liina Kamm, Dan Bogdanov, Sven Laur, and Jaak Vilo. A New Way to Protect Privacy in Large-Scale Genome-Wide Association Studies. Bioinformatics, 29(7):886â€“893, 2013.)
6. Data exchange from clinical trials.
7. Representing / confirming milestones, replacing NDAs for discussion, due diligences, efficacy
